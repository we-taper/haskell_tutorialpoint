# Notes

- The section [Input and Output][1] talks about useful tools to deal with IO. But they were skipped.
- The section [Functionally Solving Problem][2] tires to help the reader to solver problems by composing different functions. However, the solutions are unreadable. For example the stack structure is implemented with minimal code that does not give the reader a hint ("Hey, guess what, it's a stack! we are pushing and popping it... without the function `push` and `pop`.).
